## Design Philosophy: Made for Developers
The code in `xchain-sdk` is not only clean, but deliberately designed to be easy to understand. We name variables and functions explicitly so that developers can immediately understand what each line of code does. Our goal is for you to be productive in minutes, not hours.

üöÄ SDK READY FOR PRODUCTION!

üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap & Vision
This project is divided into two distinct parts: the Core SDK, which is a complete and ready-to-use utility, and the Pro Vision, a full-stack DeFi platform that represents the future of this project, contingent on funding and resources.
xChain SDK - CORE (‚úÖ Stable & Ready to Use)
The Core SDK is a powerful, reliable, and free open-source tool designed to simplify multi-chain interactions. The goal for the Core SDK is to be the best utility library for developers.
Completed Features:
 * Full Multi-Chain Infrastructure: Setup for 12+ EVM chains and Solana.
 * Complete Read Operations: Fetching native/token balances, reading contract data, multicall, and network health checks.
 * Wallet Management: Secure generation and management of wallets.
Finalizing for v1.0 Release:
 * [üü°] Full Transaction Handler: Implementing sendTransaction and executeContract to complete the core read/write capabilities.
 * [üü°] Basic NFT & Data Utilities: Adding essential functions for viewing NFTs and fetching transaction history.
 * [üîµ] Chainlink Price Oracle: Integrating Chainlink price feeds as a high-value, reliable utility for all users.
 * [üü°] Comprehensive Documentation: Finalizing docs to ensure the Core SDK is easy to adopt.
üöÄ The Vision: xChain PRO - The Universal Asset Translator
Beyond the Core SDK lies the vision for xChain Pro: a true "any-to-any" cross-chain swap aggregator that will begin by mastering the busiest corridor in crypto: EVM chains and Solana.
The User Experience We Will Build:
Imagine a user sending native ETH from Ethereum and seamlessly receiving USDC on the Solana network in a single transaction. Or sending SOL from Solana and having it arrive as USDT on Polygon.
The user simply states their intent ("I have this, I want that"), and the aggregator executes the most optimal path‚Äîbridging and swapping automatically between the EVM and Solana ecosystems.
The Technical Challenge & The Opportunity:
Mastering the EVM-Solana corridor alone is a massive engineering undertaking. It requires a world-class smart routing engine, deep integration with EVM-Solana bridges (like Wormhole), liquidity sources on both sides (like Uniswap and Orca), a robust off-chain relayer network, and uncompromising security audits.
This is the multi-chain future we are building towards, starting with the most important connection. It is a multi-million dollar opportunity that requires a dedicated team and significant resources.
‚≠ê Call to Action: We have the blueprint. Let's build the future of interoperability.
We are actively seeking funding, grants, or strategic partners to accelerate the development of xChain Pro and capture this critical market. If you are an investor, a venture fund, or a grant provider looking to fund foundational infrastructure for the multi-chain world, let's connect. Once the EVM-Solana bridge is perfected, we will expand to other ecosystems.
üîß Configuration
You can configure the SDK with custom RPC URLs and other options. Here's an example:
import { EVMSDK, SolanaSDK } from '@ixuxoinzo/xchain-sdk';
import 'dotenv/config';

// For EVM
const evm = new EVMSDK(process.env.EVM_PRIVATE_KEY!, 'ETHEREUM', {
  rpcUrl: process.env.ETHEREUM_RPC_URL, // Optional: override default RPC
});

// For Solana
const solana = new SolanaSDK(process.env.SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY!, {
  rpcUrl: process.env.SOLANA_RPC_URL, // Optional: override default RPC
});

üîå Adding a Custom Chain
The SDK is not limited to the pre-configured chains. You can dynamically add support for any EVM-compatible network at runtime using the addChain function. For implementation details, please refer to the source code or upcoming documentation.
