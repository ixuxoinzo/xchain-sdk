# üöÄ xChain SDK - Multi-Chain Blockchain SDK

## Design Philosophy: Made for Developers
The code in xchain-sdk is not only clean, but deliberately designed to be easy to understand. We name variables and functions explicitly so that developers can immediately understand what each line of code does. Our goal is for you to be productive in minutes, not hours.

---

## üåü Features

### üõ† **Comprehensive Multi-Chain Support**
- **Ethereum** and **Leading L2 Networks**: Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, zkSync, Linea, Scroll, and more.
- **Solana** with full SPL Token, NFT, and native SOL support.
- **Unified API** for seamless interactions across all supported chains.

### üí∞ **Native & Token Operations**
- Get native coin (ETH, MATIC, SOL, etc.) balances.
- Get ERC20/SPL token balances.
- Transfer native coins.
- Transfer ERC20/SPL tokens.

## üöÄ Quick Start & Examples

This repository includes a comprehensive demo script located at `demo.ts`.

### Installation for Users

To use the SDK in your own project, install it from NPM:
```bash
npm install @ixuxoinzo/xchain-sdk

Running the Included Demo
To run the complete demo script (demo.ts) from this repository:
1. Setup
First, install the dependencies from the project's root directory.
# Install all dependencies from the project root
npm install

2. Run the Demo
The unified demo script can be run in different modes from the project root:
 * To run the core scripts (backend/CLI examples):
   This will execute demonstrations for features like balance checks and contract calls directly in your terminal.
<!-- end list -->
npm run start

 * To run the interactive dApp (frontend demo):
   This will start a local development server and open a web-based dApp in your browser to showcase client-side integration.
<!-- end list -->
npm run dev

Example Output
Running the npm run start command will produce a detailed output in your terminal, demonstrating the SDK's core functionalities:

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap & Vision

This project is divided into two distinct parts: the **Core SDK**, which is a complete and ready-to-use utility, and the **Pro Vision**, a full-stack DeFi platform that represents the future of this project, contingent on funding and resources.

### **xChain SDK - CORE (Stable & Ready to Use)**

The Core SDK is a powerful, reliable, and **free open-source tool** designed to simplify multi-chain interactions. The goal for the Core SDK is to be the best utility library for developers.

#### **Completed Features:**
-   ~~**Full Multi-Chain Infrastructure:** Setup for 12+ EVM chains and Solana.~~
-   ~~**Complete Read Operations:** Fetching native/token balances, reading contract data, multicall, and network health checks.~~
-   ~~**Wallet Management:** Secure generation and management of wallets.~~
-   ~~**Basic NFT & Data Utilities:** Adding essential functions for viewing NFTs and fetching transaction history.
-   ~~ **Chainlink Price Oracle:** Integrating Chainlink price feeds as a high-value, reliable utility for all users.~~

#### **Finalizing for v1.0 Release:**
-   [üü°] **Full Transaction Handler:** Implementing `sendTransaction` and `executeContract` to complete the core read/write capabilities.
-   [üü°] **Comprehensive Documentation:** Finalizing docs to ensure the Core SDK is easy to adopt.

### üöÄ The Vision: xChain PRO - The Universal Asset Translator

Beyond the Core SDK lies the vision for xChain Pro: a true **"any-to-any" cross-chain swap aggregator** that will begin by mastering the busiest corridor in crypto: **EVM chains and Solana.**

**The User Experience We Will Build:**

Imagine a user sending native **ETH** from **Ethereum** and seamlessly receiving **USDC on the Solana network** in a single transaction. Or sending **SOL** from **Solana** and having it arrive as **USDT on Polygon**.

The user simply states their intent ("I have this, I want that"), and the aggregator executes the most optimal path‚Äîbridging and swapping automatically between the EVM and Solana ecosystems.

**The Technical Challenge & The Opportunity:**

Mastering the EVM-Solana corridor alone is a massive engineering undertaking. It requires a world-class smart routing engine, deep integration with EVM-Solana bridges (like Wormhole), liquidity sources on both sides (like Uniswap and Orca), a robust off-chain relayer network, and uncompromising security audits.

This is the multi-chain future we are building towards, starting with the most important connection. It is a multi-million dollar opportunity that requires a dedicated team and significant resources.

‚≠ê **Call to Action: We have the blueprint. Let's build the future of interoperability.**

We are actively seeking **funding, grants, or strategic partners** to accelerate the development of xChain Pro and capture this critical market. If you are an investor, a venture fund, or a grant provider looking to fund foundational infrastructure for the multi-chain world, let's connect. Once the EVM-Solana bridge is perfected, we will expand to other ecosystems.



üîß Configuration
You can configure the SDK with custom RPC URLs and other options. Here's an example:
import { EVMSDK, SolanaSDK } from '@ixuxoinzo/xchain-sdk';
import 'dotenv/config';

// For EVM
const evm = new EVMSDK(process.env.EVM_PRIVATE_KEY!, 'ETHEREUM', {
  rpcUrl: process.env.ETHEREUM_RPC_URL, // Optional: override default RPC
});

// For Solana
const solana = new SolanaSDK(process.env.SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY!, {
  rpcUrl: process.env.SOLANA_RPC_URL, // Optional: override default RPC
});
